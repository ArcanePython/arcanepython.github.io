## Blender

For MSFS scenery modelling, Blender and 3dsMax are currently the 3d-design programs of choice.

Microsoft Flight Simulator has adopted the glTF format for 3d models in its ModelLib scenery.

For this tutorial, I'll focus on Blender export. 

In order to run exports to glTF in the specific MSFS format, you will need to install the **Blender2MSFS addon**,

In Blender, you can model buildings, street lights, traffic, plants and nature..
E.g. a roof can be modeled, with the Extrude Bevel option,

In Blender, all kinds of fancy Land Art objects can be created, like

Blender can also do animated objects. I am not sure if all animated objects can be exported in a working 
state to glTF.
