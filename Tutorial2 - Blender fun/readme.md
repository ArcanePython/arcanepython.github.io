## Blender Fun

For MSFS scenery modelling, Blender and 3dsMax are currently the 3d-design programs of choice.
For this tutorial, I'll focus on Blender export. 

In order to run exports to glTF in the specific MSFS format, you will need to install the **Blender2MSFS addon**,

In Blender, you can model aircraft, aircraft liveries, lights, buildings, street lights, traffic, plants, animals, nature..

E.g. a roof can be modeled, with the Extrude Bevel option,

In Blender, all kinds of fancy Land Art objects can be created, like

Blender can also do animated objects. I am not sure if all animated objects can be exported in a working/ 
state to glTF.

<b>File format information</b>

Microsoft Flight Simulator has adopted the glTF format for 3d models in its ModelLib scenery.
